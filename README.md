# machine-learning-project
Learning git and github masterclass from Vizuara.ai - Excellent resource. 
 The teacher speaks in monotone but the way he teaches, gets you the concept with minimal effort on the part of the student.
 I am reminded of a sentence use by one of my teacher - It makes the learning as easy as eating a ripe banana.
